# Exploration of OECD Healthcare data using SQL

The OECD cancer data provides a rich dataset for exploring and analyzing cancer death ratios across different countries and regions.
By applying SQL techniques to this data, one can gain insights into trends and patterns in cancer deaths,
as well as identify potential factors that may influence these trends. While the quality of the input data may not be optimal for making definitive conclusions,
it provides an opportunity to practice cleaning and transforming data for analysis purposes.

This exercise can involve identifying missing or erroneous data, dealing with outliers,
and transforming data into a more suitable format for analysis. Through this exploration of the OECD cancer data,
one can gain valuable experience in using SQL to extract insights from complex datasets.

Additionally, the process of cleaning and transforming data can serve as a foundation for more advanced analytical techniques,
such as machine learning and predictive modeling, which can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios.

All queries used to clean and improve data quality.
1. Joining tables from other databases
2. Initial data analysis
3. Track how many values are empty
4. Adding new records
5. Deleting invalid records
6. Filling the blanks with the mean
7. Final correction of data format and visualization
8. Summary
